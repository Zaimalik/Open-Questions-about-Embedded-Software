1.What are the main features of Real-Time Operating Systems and how do 
they differ from regular OSâ€™s?
-The main feature of RTOS among regular OS is that it designed to use in
critical applications that relate to automation, measurement and control.
In these applications a fast and real time response will affect the whole process. 
For that and for more precise response RTOS deals good with interruption by using 
priority-based functioning.

2.When is it preferable to use STM32 over Arduino, ESP32, PIC or other 
comparable embedded system?
- STM32 in  general used for industrial manner and it used as a product 
for professional developer 

3.Let's assume that a few of the peripherals you use have the same 
hardcoded I2C address. What solution would you use to solve this problem?
-Multiplexer 
-Use different serial clock for each device

4.Let's assume that there is a hardware module that is attached to the 
motherboard with a mezzanine connector. Due to the small form factor, 
the number of pins on the mezzanine connector is much less than the 
number of pins you need. Assuming that the communication speed is not 
important, how would you solve this problem?
-

5.Let's say you want about 30 hardware modules to communicate with each 
other. There is one STM32 microcontroller on each module, and the modules
can be removed and installed instantly. Which communication standard would 
you use for these modules to communicate effectively with each other? Why?
- LORA communication protocol is suitable for communication for a multi 
device module. It features long range with low battery usage in addition 
to low cost and security.

6.3 devices with identical embedded software and hardware are required to
communicate over I2C. What kind of solution would you develop so that 
devices can be dynamically addressed and recognize each other?
-Multiplexer
